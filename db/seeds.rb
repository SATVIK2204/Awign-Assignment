# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Course.destroy_all

# c1 = Course.create(name: "Math 101")
# c2 = Course.create(name: "Coding 102")
# c3 = Course.create(name: "Chemisty")
# c4 = Course.create(name: "Biology")
# c5 = Course.create(name: "Machine Learning")
